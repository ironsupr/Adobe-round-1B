# Adobe Hackathon Challenge 1B - Requirements
# Optimized for CPU-only execution and fast performance

# Core PDF processing
PyMuPDF>=1.23.0

# System monitoring (for resource constraints)
psutil>=5.9.0

# Standard library dependencies (no additional installs needed)
# - argparse (built-in)
# - os (built-in)
# - sys (built-in)
# - re (built-in)
# - json (built-in)
# - datetime (built-in)
# - pathlib (built-in)
# - typing (built-in)

# Note: This solution uses a lightweight keyword-based approach
# instead of heavy ML models to meet the <1GB model size and
# <60 seconds execution time constraints
